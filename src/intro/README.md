# Mobx

- Simple, scalable state management
- A battle tested library
- transparently applying functional reactive programming (TFRP).

**The philosophy behind MobX is very simple:**

`Anything that can be derived from the application state, should be derived. Automatically.`

which includes the UI, data serialization, server communication, etc.
